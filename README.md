# Arch Linux General set up
This repo is to save my general set up for arch Linux, to facillitate re-installing linux.  It should set up arch and also sets of graphic design and utility packages.

## List of graphic design packages
1. Blender3D
2. Krita
3. Inkscape
4. pinta

## List of utility packages
1. Git
2. Neovim
3. MPV
4. FFMPEG
5. Obsidian

Hopefully I keep learning bash and zsh for continuing this.

If anyone stumbles upon this in the future, when it's better shaped, I hope you find it usefull or interesting.
